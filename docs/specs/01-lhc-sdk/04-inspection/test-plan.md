# Epic 04: Inspection — Test Plan

**Epic:** `epic.md` (23 ACs / 17 TCs) · **Tech design:** `tech-design.md`
Inherits Epic 01–03 test architecture: real temp SQLite per test, deterministic provider for fixture prep only, default suite (`pnpm verify`) + process suite (`LHC_PROCESS_SUITE=1 pnpm verify-all`), suite-accounting row, red manifest discipline.

## Test Files

| File | Suite | Covers |
|------|-------|--------|
| `test/messages-read.test.ts` | default | TC-3.1–3.3 + list/show read-only legs |
| `test/inspect-overview.test.ts` | default | TC-1.1–1.3 |
| `test/inspect-view.test.ts` | default | TC-2.1–2.3 + describe legs |
| `test/inspect-health.test.ts` | default | TC-4.1–4.3 |
| `test/lifecycle.test.ts` | default | TC-5.1–5.3 |
| `test/cli-process-inspect.test.ts` | process | TC-3.4, TC-5.4 |
| `test/fixtures/lifecycle.ts` | (helper) | the scripted sequence both suites drive |

Fixture: Epic 03's tool-heavy fixture reused; extended in place (Story 2) with a mutation-in-flight variant — one edit applied, drain *not* settled, so cleared-pending states are real production states, not hand-written rows (FC-fidelity rule carried from Epic 03 Story 0: states reached through intake → mutate → partial drain, never direct `derived_form` writes).

## TC → Test Mapping

| TC | Test (file :: name) | Assertion spine |
|----|--------------------|-----------------|
| TC-1.1 | inspect-overview :: full shape variants | fresh-empty, mid-first-turn, never-compacted-with-record, compacted, and mid-rebuild all return the full shape with absent pieces as zeros/nulls; compacted fixture exact counts per section vs fixture ground truth |
| TC-1.2 | inspect-overview :: deleted accounting | delete one → visible−1, deleted=1, kind map excludes, tokens drop by its estimate, event count unchanged |
| TC-1.3 | inspect-overview :: purity | two calls, no writes between → deep-equal; read-only delta assert green; zero provider calls |
| TC-2.1 | inspect-view :: arrangement fidelity | entries/forms/degraded/gap reasons/config/provenance equal `describe` output equal stored row (degraded + gap fixture) |
| TC-2.2 | inspect-view :: loadCost parity on boundary-advanced fixture | tail costs short forms short; `total` = estimator over an independent `pull`'s messages |
| TC-2.3 | inspect-view :: never-compacted | `meta: null`, bands `[]`, tail spans record, parity holds |
| TC-3.1 | messages-read :: order, fields, bounds | record order; kind/tokens/turnId present; `from`/`to`/`limit` exact windows; `from > to` → `caller_error` |
| TC-3.2 | messages-read :: show full record + forms | drained tool-result: full content (not shortened), forms with states, outcome metadata present |
| TC-3.3 | messages-read :: deleted handling | default list excludes; `includeDeleted` marks; show on deleted → ok + flag; show on missing id → `message_not_found` |
| TC-3.4 | cli-process-inspect :: list/show parity | spawned `lhc messages list/show` JSON deep-equals in-process SDK results |
| TC-4.1 | inspect-health :: counts + queue consistency | mixed-state fixture: exact counts per owner/kind/state; queue section equals live-item counts from the same reports |
| TC-4.2 | inspect-health :: failure detail + preview | failed: reason/attempts/lastError exact; blocked excluded from preview; preview = failed∧¬blocked set exactly |
| TC-4.3 | inspect-health :: rebuild bracket | edit → health: cascade set pending with queued work visible (exact subjects per cascade contract); `drainSettled` → same set ready; disjoint forms untouched |
| TC-5.1 | lifecycle :: full sequence + checkpoints | every phase ok; post-compact pull = bands+tail; mutate → pending; drain → ready; compact2 reflects edit; receipt sweep section field-equals pre-compact health snapshot |
| TC-5.2 | lifecycle :: replay determinism | fresh thread, same script → literal hash-equal pull outputs; materialized file hash-equal after normalizing only the random thread id (ids asserted to differ, every other byte exact) |
| TC-5.3 | lifecycle :: teardown continuity | `freshSdk` between phase groups → final pull/health/file identical to TC-5.1 run |
| TC-5.4 | cli-process-inspect :: checkpoint parity | spawned CLI overview/view/list at three checkpoints deep-equal in-process results at same checkpoints |

## Architecture-Risk Tests

| Risk | Test | Why it bites |
|------|------|--------------|
| Inspect quietly writes (work rows, boundary nudge, view touch) | **read-only delta assert**: shared helper snapshots observable state (queued work via owners, boundary/zone via status, view identity via describe, event/message counts) before/after *every* new operation; deep-equal after. Runs inside each TC file via wrapper | A single forgotten side effect makes "inspect describes, never changes" fiction; absence-of-delta is checkable, absence-of-write-code is not |
| Zero-provider on all new ops | suite-wide assert extended: overview/view/health/describe/show/list under a throwing provider config → all ok | The no-inference NFR stays structural through the last epic |
| `loadCost` drifts from served reality | TC-2.2's independent-pull leg + lifecycle TC-5.1 checkpoint (report at compact1 vs pull1) | Parity by construction can still break at the estimator seam; two independent measurements pin it |
| Health re-derives instead of composing | health tests assert composition through owner surfaces only: `check-boundaries` forbids cross-domain internal imports, an Epic 04 source check rejects raw SQL references to other domains' tables from `domains/inspect/**`, and the read-only delta assert separately catches writes | The must-not-own rule is the domain's entire contract |
| Lifecycle order bugs only visible cross-epic | TC-5.1's named-phase checkpoints; receipt-vs-health field equality | First sequence ever to run all surfaces in PI-extension order; seam drift between three separately-built epics surfaces here or in production |

## Suite Accounting

Default suite grows ~26 tests across 5 files. Process suite grows TC-3.4 + TC-5.4 (2 spawned scenarios, ~6 assertions); accounting row carried: process suite `ran | not-ran` recorded per verify-all invocation, never silently skipped.

## Chunk Red/Green Detail

**Chunk 1 — message reads (S1).** Red: `show` absent from surface (structured not-implemented per house stub rule); list opts ignored — bounds test fails on full-list return. Green: opts → WHERE/LIMIT; show + report join; `cli/messages-read.ts`; TC-3.1–3.3 + read-only legs. ~8 tests.

**Chunk 2 — inspect domain (S2).** Red: `inspect.*` stubs return not-implemented; fixture lacks mutation-variant (TC-4.3 unwritable → fixture work first). Green: `shared/inspect.ts` shapes; overview composition; health composition; `cli/inspect.ts`; delta-assert helper lands here and wraps Chunk 1's ops retroactively. TC-1.1–1.3, TC-4.1–4.3. ~11 tests.

**Chunk 3 — view report (S3).** Red: `describe` absent; `inspect.view` stub. Green: `describe` (row → `StoredView`), `view-report.ts` (describe + pull → report), TC-2.1–2.3 + describe null/shape legs. ~6 tests.

**Chunk 4 — lifecycle (S4).** Red: `lifecycle.ts` helper absent; all four TC files reference it. Green: script with named phases + `freshSdk` hook; TC-5.1–5.3 default; TC-5.4 process. ~7 tests (4 scenarios, multi-checkpoint).

## Verification

Per-story: `pnpm verify` (lint, typecheck, default suites). Story 4 and epic close: `LHC_PROCESS_SUITE=1 pnpm verify-all` — process suite must report `ran`. Red manifests regenerated per chunk per house discipline; no Epic 01–03 test amendments expected (additive surfaces only — list-opts default behavior is unchanged, existing `listMessages` callers see identical results).
