# Story Lead Base Prompt

## Role Charter
You are the story lead for `03-view-contents-report` on durable story run `03-view-contents-report-story-run-001`.
Select exactly one bounded next action for this `run` turn.
This is planner turn 1.
Do not invent tools, bypass the bounded action protocol, or rely on hidden provider session memory.

## Authority Boundary
Impl-lead stays outside this loop and owns final story acceptance, receipts, commits, cleanup dispatch, and epic progression.
You may recommend acceptance, request a ruling, or block the story, but you do not accept the story on behalf of impl-lead.

## Requirements Source
Treat the story file and test plan below as the story-local requirements source for this turn.
Do not pull in epic, tech design, git status, git diff, or workspace summaries unless they are already present in the durable record below.

# Story 3: View-Contents Report

### Summary
<!-- Jira: Summary field -->
Expose the stored active view through `threadView.describe` and report view contents with load-cost parity to `pull`.

### Description
<!-- Jira: Description field -->
**User Profile:** The operator audits what the agent actually saw; agents inside a harness use the same read mid-task.

**Objective:** Report stored view bands, gaps, provenance, tail cost, and total load cost without recomputing the view.

**Scope In:** `threadView.describe`, `inspect.view`, `lhc inspect view`, stored snapshot reporting, tail cost as served, load-cost equality with `pull`.

**Scope Out:** No view derivation, repair, mutation, provider invocation, or direct inspect-domain reads of `thread_view` tables.

**Dependencies:** Epic 03 Stories 0-2 landed for view storage and `pull`; Story 2 inspect surface conventions available.

### Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Jira: Acceptance Criteria field -->
- **AC-2.1**: The report names the active view — viewId, createdAt, profile name and resolved config, compactPoint, coveredFrom — and lists every band entry in served order (brief → detailed → smooth): subject kind and id, form used, degraded flag; plus every gap with its reason; plus per-band stored token counts. All of it from the stored snapshot, not recomputed.

- **AC-2.2**: The tail section reports message count and token cost *as currently served*: tool results at-or-behind the visibility boundary are costed at their short form, everything else full.

- **AC-2.3**: `loadCost` totals what `pull` serves now — bands plus tail — and a test asserts equality against an actual pull's measured content. The report never disagrees with the surface it describes.

- **AC-2.4**: A never-compacted thread reports view: null with a tail-only loadCost under the same equality contract (the whole record served as tail).

- **AC-2.5**: The report carries the view's recorded source-state provenance (what the compact saw: max event order, form counts) and is a pure read under AC-1.4's contract.

- **TC-2.1** (AC-2.1, AC-2.5): On a compacted fixture with one degraded entry and one gap → report matches the stored arrangement exactly: subjects, forms used, degraded flags, gap reasons, band token counts, config, provenance.

- **TC-2.2** (AC-2.2, AC-2.3): On a boundary-advanced fixture → tail cost counts short forms short; `loadCost.total` equals the token measure of an actual `pull`'s messages using the same estimator.

- **TC-2.3** (AC-2.4): Never-compacted thread → view null, tail spans the record, cost-parity assertion holds.

### Technical Design
<!-- Jira: Technical Notes or sub-section of Description -->
#### Architecture Context

This story adds the single thread-view surface Epic 04 needs: `threadView.describe`. It exposes the stored active view row from the owning domain so inspect never reads thread-view tables directly.

`inspect.view` combines `describe` and `pull`. The stored arrangement, gaps, config, stored band tokens, and source-state provenance come from `describe`; tail cost comes from measured pull output, making load-cost parity structural.

#### Build Strategy

Strategy: tdd-lite

Reason:
- The story has one governing contract, but `loadCost` can drift if implementers reimplement pull selection or boundary-aware shortening.

Risk Reminders:
- `describe` must return the stored snapshot, not recompute it.
- Never-compacted threads return `meta: null`, empty bands, and tail-only cost.
- `inspect.view` inherits served tail behavior from `pull`.

#### Implementation Targets

#### Test Mapping

| TC | Test File / Check | Test Description |
|----|-------------------|------------------|
| TC-2.1 | `test/inspect-view.test.ts :: arrangement fidelity` | Report entries, forms, degraded flags, gap reasons, config, and provenance equal `describe` output and stored row. |
| TC-2.2 | `test/inspect-view.test.ts :: loadCost parity on boundary-advanced fixture` | Tail costs short forms short and total equals estimator over an independent pull. |
| TC-2.3 | `test/inspect-view.test.ts :: never-compacted` | `meta: null`, empty bands, tail spans the record, and cost parity holds. |

#### Architecture-Risk Tests

| Risk | Test File / Check | Test Description | Why AC/TC Mapping Alone Would Miss It |
|------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Load cost drifts from served reality | `test/inspect-view.test.ts` independent-pull leg | Measure report total against a second pull's served messages. | A report can look plausible while disagreeing with what agents actually receive. |
| Inspect reads thread-view storage directly | `check-boundaries` plus source check | Inspect must consume `threadView.describe` and `threadView.pull`. | Direct table reads could pass fixture assertions while violating ownership. |
| Describe mutates or recomputes | `test/inspect-view.test.ts` describe legs and read-only delta helper | Null/shape behavior and before/after state equality are asserted. | Stored snapshot fidelity requires source and side-effect checks, not just output fields. |

#### Technical Notes

- `threadView.describe` returns ok/null for absent views.
- `inspect.view` should not recompute arrangement, form choice, gaps, or source-state provenance.
- `loadCost.bandTokens` sums stored band counts; tail tokens are measured from pull's served tail.

#### Anti-Shim Requirements

- Compare report content to stored row data and to independent pull output.
- Do not fake parity by sharing a helper that bypasses `pull`.
- Do not create new storage or migration to support this read.

#### Production Path Proof

- Entrypoint: `threadView.describe`, `inspect.view`, `lhc inspect view`.
- Registration/default path: `src/sdk.ts` exposes `threadView.describe` and inspect view; `src/cli/inspect.ts` routes `view` to SDK.
- Evidence: default-suite inspect-view tests plus process checkpoint parity in the lifecycle story.

#### Verification

- Targeted: `pnpm verify`
- Story gate: `pnpm verify`
- Epic/process gate: `LHC_PROCESS_SUITE=1 pnpm verify-all`

#### Spec Deviations

None.

### Definition of Done
<!-- Jira: Definition of Done or Acceptance Criteria footer -->
- `threadView.describe` exposes the stored active view row read-only and returns null when absent.
- `inspect.view` reports stored bands, gaps, config, provenance, tail, and loadCost.
- `loadCost.total` equals measured `pull` content for compacted and never-compacted threads.
- `lhc inspect view` returns SDK-parity JSON.
- TC-2.1 through TC-2.3 pass with one primary owner in this story.

# Epic 04: Inspection — Test Plan

**Epic:** `epic.md` (23 ACs / 17 TCs) · **Tech design:** `tech-design.md`
Inherits Epic 01–03 test architecture: real temp SQLite per test, deterministic provider for fixture prep only, default suite (`pnpm verify`) + process suite (`LHC_PROCESS_SUITE=1 pnpm verify-all`), suite-accounting row, red manifest discipline.

## Test Files

| File | Suite | Covers |
|------|-------|--------|
| `test/messages-read.test.ts` | default | TC-3.1–3.3 + list/show read-only legs |
| `test/inspect-overview.test.ts` | default | TC-1.1–1.3 |
| `test/inspect-view.test.ts` | default | TC-2.1–2.3 + describe legs |
| `test/inspect-health.test.ts` | default | TC-4.1–4.3 |
| `test/lifecycle.test.ts` | default | TC-5.1–5.3 |
| `test/cli-process-inspect.test.ts` | process | TC-3.4, TC-5.4 |
| `test/fixtures/lifecycle.ts` | (helper) | the scripted sequence both suites drive |

Fixture: Epic 03's tool-heavy fixture reused; extended in place (Story 2) with a mutation-in-flight variant — one edit applied, drain *not* settled, so cleared-pending states are real production states, not hand-written rows (FC-fidelity rule carried from Epic 03 Story 0: states reached through intake → mutate → partial drain, never direct `derived_form` writes).

## TC → Test Mapping

| TC | Test (file :: name) | Assertion spine |
|----|--------------------|-----------------|
| TC-1.1 | inspect-overview :: full shape variants | fresh-empty, mid-first-turn, never-compacted-with-record, compacted, and mid-rebuild all return the full shape with absent pieces as zeros/nulls; compacted fixture exact counts per section vs fixture ground truth |
| TC-1.2 | inspect-overview :: deleted accounting | delete one → visible−1, deleted=1, kind map excludes, tokens drop by its estimate, event count unchanged |
| TC-1.3 | inspect-overview :: purity | two calls, no writes between → deep-equal; read-only delta assert green; zero provider calls |
| TC-2.1 | inspect-view :: arrangement fidelity | entries/forms/degraded/gap reasons/config/provenance equal `describe` output equal stored row (degraded + gap fixture) |
| TC-2.2 | inspect-view :: loadCost parity on boundary-advanced fixture | tail costs short forms short; `total` = estimator over an independent `pull`'s messages |
| TC-2.3 | inspect-view :: never-compacted | `meta: null`, bands `[]`, tail spans record, parity holds |
| TC-3.1 | messages-read :: order, fields, bounds | record order; kind/tokens/turnId present; `from`/`to`/`limit` exact windows; `from > to` → `caller_error` |
| TC-3.2 | messages-read :: show full record + forms | drained tool-result: full content (not shortened), forms with states, outcome metadata present |
| TC-3.3 | messages-read :: deleted handling | default list excludes; `includeDeleted` marks; show on deleted → ok + flag; show on missing id → `message_not_found` |
| TC-3.4 | cli-process-inspect :: list/show parity | spawned `lhc messages list/show` JSON deep-equals in-process SDK results |
| TC-4.1 | inspect-health :: counts + queue consistency | mixed-state fixture: exact counts per owner/kind/state; queue section equals live-item counts from the same reports |
| TC-4.2 | inspect-health :: failure detail + preview | failed: reason/attempts/lastError exact; blocked excluded from preview; preview = failed∧¬blocked set exactly |
| TC-4.3 | inspect-health :: rebuild bracket | edit → health: cascade set pending with queued work visible (exact subjects per cascade contract); `drainSettled` → same set ready; disjoint forms untouched |
| TC-5.1 | lifecycle :: full sequence + checkpoints | every phase ok; post-compact pull = bands+tail; mutate → pending; drain → ready; compact2 reflects edit; receipt sweep section field-equals pre-compact health snapshot |
| TC-5.2 | lifecycle :: replay determinism | fresh thread, same script → hash-equal pull outputs and materialized file |
| TC-5.3 | lifecycle :: teardown continuity | `freshSdk` between phase groups → final pull/health/file identical to TC-5.1 run |
| TC-5.4 | cli-process-inspect :: checkpoint parity | spawned CLI overview/view/list at three checkpoints deep-equal in-process results at same checkpoints |

## Architecture-Risk Tests

| Risk | Test | Why it bites |
|------|------|--------------|
| Inspect quietly writes (work rows, boundary nudge, view touch) | **read-only delta assert**: shared helper snapshots observable state (queued work via owners, boundary/zone via status, view identity via describe, event/message counts) before/after *every* new operation; deep-equal after. Runs inside each TC file via wrapper | A single forgotten side effect makes "inspect describes, never changes" fiction; absence-of-delta is checkable, absence-of-write-code is not |
| Zero-provider on all new ops | suite-wide assert extended: overview/view/health/describe/show/list under a throwing provider config → all ok | The no-inference NFR stays structural through the last epic |
| `loadCost` drifts from served reality | TC-2.2's independent-pull leg + lifecycle TC-5.1 checkpoint (report at compact1 vs pull1) | Parity by construction can still break at the estimator seam; two independent measurements pin it |
| Health re-derives instead of composing | health tests assert composition through owner surfaces only: `check-boundaries` forbids cross-domain internal imports, an Epic 04 source check rejects raw SQL references to other domains' tables from `domains/inspect/**`, and the read-only delta assert separately catches writes | The must-not-own rule is the domain's entire contract |
| Lifecycle order bugs only visible cross-epic | TC-5.1's named-phase checkpoints; receipt-vs-health field equality | First sequence ever to run all surfaces in PI-extension order; seam drift between three separately-built epics surfaces here or in production |

## Suite Accounting

Default suite grows ~26 tests across 5 files. Process suite grows TC-3.4 + TC-5.4 (2 spawned scenarios, ~6 assertions); accounting row carried: process suite `ran | not-ran` recorded per verify-all invocation, never silently skipped.

## Chunk Red/Green Detail

**Chunk 1 — message reads (S1).** Red: `show` absent from surface (structured not-implemented per house stub rule); list opts ignored — bounds test fails on full-list return. Green: opts → WHERE/LIMIT; show + report join; `cli/messages-read.ts`; TC-3.1–3.3 + read-only legs. ~8 tests.

**Chunk 2 — inspect domain (S2).** Red: `inspect.*` stubs return not-implemented; fixture lacks mutation-variant (TC-4.3 unwritable → fixture work first). Green: `shared/inspect.ts` shapes; overview composition; health composition; `cli/inspect.ts`; delta-assert helper lands here and wraps Chunk 1's ops retroactively. TC-1.1–1.3, TC-4.1–4.3. ~11 tests.

**Chunk 3 — view report (S3).** Red: `describe` absent; `inspect.view` stub. Green: `describe` (row → `StoredView`), `view-report.ts` (describe + pull → report), TC-2.1–2.3 + describe null/shape legs. ~6 tests.

**Chunk 4 — lifecycle (S4).** Red: `lifecycle.ts` helper absent; all four TC files reference it. Green: script with named phases + `freshSdk` hook; TC-5.1–5.3 default; TC-5.4 process. ~7 tests (4 scenarios, multi-checkpoint).

## Verification

Per-story: `pnpm verify` (lint, typecheck, default suites). Story 4 and epic close: `LHC_PROCESS_SUITE=1 pnpm verify-all` — process suite must report `ran`. Red manifests regenerated per chunk per house discipline; no Epic 01–03 test amendments expected (additive surfaces only — list-opts default behavior is unchanged, existing `listMessages` callers see identical results).

## State Rules
### state-rules
Bytes: 2986

Requirements source for story-local acceptance: the story file and test plan below.
Current lifecycle state: awaiting_story_lead_action

Lifecycle rules:
State: initialized
Public status: running
Allowed actions: none
Meaning: Runtime scaffolding exists, but no planner turn or child operation has started yet.
Caller implication: Treat this as startup bookkeeping only; wait for the first planner transition before routing work.

State: awaiting_story_lead_action
Public status: running
Allowed actions: run-implement, run-continue, run-self-review, run-verify, run-quick-fix, accept-story, request-ruling, block-story, fail-story
Meaning: The durable record is ready and the next fresh story-lead turn may choose one bounded action.
Caller implication: Planner output is the next source of truth; the run is waiting for a valid bounded action selection.

State: running_child_operation
Public status: running
Allowed actions: none
Meaning: The runtime is executing one bounded child operation selected by the story lead.
Caller implication: Poll runtime artifacts instead of rerouting; the current child operation is still in flight.

State: recording_result
Public status: running
Allowed actions: none
Meaning: The child result or terminal decision is being written to durable artifacts before the next transition.
Caller implication: Do not treat the run as advanced until evidence and ledger updates are durably recorded.

State: terminal
Public status: terminal-only
Allowed actions: none
Meaning: A terminal public outcome has been recorded separately from lifecycleState and the story-lead loop will not continue automatically.
Caller implication: Read the public status and final package to decide impl-lead follow-up such as accept, reopen, or ruling.

Terminal outcome rules:
Outcome: accepted
Meaning: Story-lead evidence is complete enough to recommend acceptance for impl-lead review.
Caller implication: Impl-lead still owes receipt completion, verification gates, and the story commit before accepting the story.

Outcome: needs-ruling
Meaning: The run reached a boundary that requires an explicit caller or maintainer decision.
Caller implication: Surface the ruling request instead of guessing or downgrading the decision into cleanup debt.

Outcome: blocked
Meaning: A named blocker prevents safe forward progress with the current inputs or runtime state.
Caller implication: Resolve the blocker or change the plan before resuming; do not pretend the story is ready to continue.

Outcome: failed
Meaning: An unrecoverable runtime or planner failure ended the current story-lead attempt.
Caller implication: Inspect the failure details and durable artifacts before deciding whether to replay or open a new attempt.

Outcome: interrupted
Meaning: The run stopped before a planned transition finished, usually because the caller or runtime interrupted it.
Caller implication: Use status or resume against the durable artifacts to continue from the last safe checkpoint.

## Runtime Settings

## Action Protocol
Return exactly one JSON object matching `StoryLeadAction`.

Examples:
{"action":"run-implement","rationale":"...","inputs":{"promptAddendum":"optional"},"selfNote":"optional durable reminder"}
{"action":"run-continue","rationale":"...","inputs":{"continuationRef":"storyImplementor","promptAddendum":"..."}}
{"action":"run-self-review","rationale":"...","inputs":{"artifactRefs":["/abs/path.json"],"focus":"optional","continuationRef":"storyImplementor","passes":1}}

{"action":"run-verify","rationale":"...","inputs":{"artifactRefs":["/abs/path.json"],"verifierContinuationRef":"storyVerifier","responseArtifactRef":"/abs/path.json"}}
{"action":"run-quick-fix","rationale":"...","inputs":{"findingRefs":["finding-001"],"remediationGoal":"...","workingDirectory":"optional"}}
{"action":"request-ruling","rationale":"...","inputs":{"decisionType":"...","question":"...","defaultRecommendation":"...","evidence":["..."],"allowedResponses":["..."]}}
{"action":"accept-story","rationale":"...","inputs":{"summary":"...","acceptanceCheckRefs":["..."],"acceptanceChecks":[{"name":"...","status":"pass","evidence":["..."],"reasoning":"..."}],"recommendedImplLeadAction":"accept"},"verification":{"finalVerifierOutcome":"pass","findings":[{"id":"...","status":"fixed","evidence":["..."]}]}}
{"action":"block-story","rationale":"...","inputs":{"reason":"...","detail":"optional","evidence":["..."]},"verification":{"finalVerifierOutcome":"block","findings":[{"id":"...","status":"unresolved","evidence":["..."]}]}}
{"action":"fail-story","rationale":"...","inputs":{"reason":"...","detail":"optional","evidence":["..."]}}

Rules:
- Choose exactly one bounded next action.
- Use only the durable story-run record in this prompt. Do not assume hidden retained planner memory exists.
- Treat `<current_response>` as the latest bounded child response and `<history_responses>` as older response history.
- If the story file and test plan are insufficient for a safe next step, request a ruling instead of asking for epic, tech design, git status, or git diff by default.
- Include `selfNote` only when you want to leave a durable reminder for a later planner turn.

## Acceptance Rubric
Choose the smallest safe bounded action that advances the story using the durable evidence already present.
Prefer continuing from valid child-operation evidence over repeating work, and keep unresolved authority-boundary questions explicit.

## Acceptance Decision Standard
Choose `accept-story` only when the latest verifier result is `pass`, no open findings remain, required proof is present, and the configured story gate passed.
If readiness is promising but gate truth is failed, unavailable, or uncertain, do not accept. Choose the smallest safe next action: verify, quick-fix, block, or request a ruling.

## Ruling Boundaries
Request a ruling when story-local requirements are insufficient, when a blocker needs a caller decision, or when the evidence conflicts in a way that the durable record cannot resolve safely.
