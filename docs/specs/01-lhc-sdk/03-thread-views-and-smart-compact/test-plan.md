# Epic 03: Thread Views and Smart Compact — Test Plan

Companion to `tech-design.md`. Maps all 27 TCs to test files, names the architecture-risk tests with their rationale, and pins the golden cases for the two deterministic algorithms. Suites follow Epic 02's segmentation: in-process vitest suites by default; spawned-process CLI suites under `LHC_PROCESS_SUITE=1`.

## Test Files

| File | Suite | Covers |
|------|-------|--------|
| `test/view-fixture.test.ts` | default | FC-0.x fixture invariants |
| `test/view-pull.test.ts` | default | TC-1.1–1.5 |
| `test/view-compact.test.ts` | default | TC-2.1–2.7 |
| `test/view-select-golden.test.ts` | default | Selection/boundary golden cases (architecture-risk) |
| `test/view-sweep.test.ts` | default | TC-3.1–3.4 |
| `test/view-boundary.test.ts` | default | TC-4.1–4.6 |
| `test/view-render-targets.test.ts` | default | TC-5.1–5.3, 5.5 |
| `test/cli-process-view.test.ts` | process | TC-5.4; CLI parity for all five commands (pull, status, compact, sweep, materialize) |

## TC → Test Mapping

| TC | ACs | Test file | Test (user-visible outcome) | Notes |
|----|-----|-----------|------------------------------|-------|
| TC-1.1 | 1.2, 1.3 | view-pull | never-compacted thread pulls full conversation in order; later intake appends | fresh temp thread, two intake rounds |
| TC-1.2 | 1.1, 1.7 | view-pull | two pulls with nothing between are byte-identical and create no work or provider calls | provider fake call-count assert |
| TC-1.3 | 1.4 | view-pull | band bytes unchanged after edit + drain of a banded subject | compact first via fixture; hash band messages |
| TC-1.4 | 1.5 | view-pull | boundary mid-tail: short behind, full ahead, non-tool always full | boundary row seeded below-SDK via a sanctioned `test/fixtures/` helper (same sanctioning as the corruption fixture); boundary mechanics owned by TC-4.x |
| TC-1.5 | 1.6 | view-pull | tail delete vanishes from next pull; banded-subject delete leaves snapshot until compact | uses messages.delete + turns.delete |
| TC-2.1 | 2.2, 2.3, 2.7 | view-compact | profile compact succeeds with config in receipt; 105% sum and unknown profile reject with named violations, thread unchanged | read-back equality after rejections |
| TC-2.2 | 2.4, 2.9 | view-compact | full-coverage compact targets the bound: receipt actuals near band shares, every deviation attributable to a whole-entry rule; zero provider calls; record untouched | record hash before/after |
| TC-2.3 | 2.5, 2.7 | view-compact | failed + pending forms degrade per ladder, receipt lists both, every subject represented | fixture's failed-transient/pending subjects |
| TC-2.4 | 2.6 | view-compact | crash injected between sweep and write: prior view serves; rerun lands clean | Story-0 injection seam |
| TC-2.5 | 2.1, 2.8 | view-pull + view-compact | status on degraded thread reports all fields; reads only; nothing compacts uninvoked | split: pre-compact legs in Story 1, view-health legs Story 2 |
| TC-2.6 | 2.10 | view-compact | band text carries §chunk/§turn keys | regex over rendered bands |
| TC-2.7 | 2.5 | view-compact | canonical corruption → `state_corruption` naming damage, prior view serves; derived-only damage → compacts with gaps | corruption fixture variant; control leg |
| TC-3.1 | 3.1–3.3 | view-sweep | sweep classifies the five seeded states correctly, requeues only transient, returns without waiting, zero provider calls | elapsed-time + provider-count asserts |
| TC-3.2 | 3.4 | view-sweep | second sweep without drain: requeued form reported in-flight, no second work row | work_item count by key |
| TC-3.3 | 3.5, 3.7 | view-sweep | standalone SDK and CLI sweep return same receipt shape and counts | CLI leg lives in process suite, asserted by shape here via shared schema |
| TC-3.4 | 3.6, 2.7 | view-sweep | default compact embeds sweep receipt; skip records skip + zero requeues; post-drain compact includes healed form | drain via background drainSettled |
| TC-4.1 | 4.3 | view-boundary | under-max batches never move boundary (byte-identical pulls); crossing batch moves once to target, oldest-first | |
| TC-4.2 | 4.1, 4.2 | view-boundary | flipped: usable summary renders summary; failed renders truncation + marker; interleaved assistant text full | |
| TC-4.3 | 4.5 | view-boundary | monster turn: advance enters open turn but the whole-message protected set stays full (newest results joined to ≥ floor; oversized-newest protected alone); turn's text messages all full | architecture-risk: floor arithmetic |
| TC-4.4 | 4.6, 4.7 | view-boundary | no backward motion across small batches; compact resets to compact point; fresh tail full | |
| TC-4.5 | 4.4, 4.8 | view-boundary + select-golden | replay equality: same record + budgets ⇒ same trajectory; max<target rejected naming constraint | golden trajectory case |
| TC-4.6 | 4.9 | view-boundary | injected advance failure: intake succeeds, boundary unmoved, status shows over-max; next batch heals | injection seam; also asserts poke still fired (drain ran) |
| TC-5.1 | 5.1 | view-render-targets | array opens with bands in gradient order then tail in record order; deterministic | |
| TC-5.2 | 5.2, 5.3 | view-render-targets | materialize/pull parity item-for-item; repeat byte-identical; thread state hash unchanged | |
| TC-5.3 | 5.4 | view-render-targets | never-compacted materialize: valid tail-only file loadable against fixture | |
| TC-5.4 | 5.5 | cli-process-view | spawned pull emits JSON array; materialize prints path, file parses; missing thread exits nonzero structured | process suite; the same file carries parity legs for the other three commands (below) |
| TC-5.5 | 5.3 | view-render-targets | materialized file validates against real-PI-session structure fixture | header line, entry shape, parentId chain |

Every TC mapped; no orphans. FC-0.x fixture invariants (each manufactured state proven by read-back; states reached through production drains) live in `view-fixture.test.ts` and run before everything in CI order.

## Architecture-Risk Tests

Beyond TC mapping — each exists because the architecture creates a hazard the ACs don't name:

| Test | File | Hazard it guards |
|------|------|------------------|
| zero-provider sweep across all five ops | view-sweep | The provider fake is in scope for fixtures; nothing stops an internal "helpful" derivation call except this assert. The epic's no-inference rule needs teeth. |
| selection replay goldens (3 cases below) | view-select-golden | AC-2.9 says deterministic; only exact-arrangement goldens catch tie-breaker drift (≤ vs <, newest-first ordering) that replay-on-same-engine misses. |
| boundary trajectory golden | view-select-golden | Same: floor/target arithmetic off-by-one survives property tests, not goldens. |
| advance/poke seam isolation | view-boundary | TC-4.6's sibling: a *throwing* advance must not eat the queue poke (drain still runs), and a failing poke must not block the advance. Ordering pinned in design Flow 4. |
| restart serves snapshot | view-compact | Snapshot durability: compact, close SDK, reopen thread file fresh, pull → identical bytes. Real-file restart, not same-process reread. |
| coverage edge accounting | view-compact | When brief budget excludes old chunks: `covered_from` correct, receipt reports exclusion, no silent omission *and* no phantom gap entries for out-of-window chunks. |
| CLI parity: compact/status/sweep | cli-process-view | Scope promises five CLI commands; spawned legs: `view compact --profile` (receipt JSON = SDK shape), `view status` (status JSON = SDK shape), `view sweep` (receipt JSON = SDK shape), plus profile-violation exit-nonzero leg. Closes the gap between claimed CLI surface and proven CLI surface. |
| CLI intake advances boundary | cli-process-view | The design's both-modes advance rule proven at the process boundary: spawned CLI intake on an over-max thread → subsequent `view pull` shows flipped results, `view status` shows zone ≤ target. Guards the seam-install class (a createSdk-only install would pass every in-process test and fail this one). |

## Golden Cases

**Selection G1 — proportions:** fixture thread, `conversation` profile (120k/12/48/20/20 scaled down by fixture factor): exact expected arrangement (subject ids per band, compact point, covered_from) checked against committed JSON golden.
**Selection G2 — budget-edge inclusion:** a turn whose rendering exactly fills the smooth remainder → included (≤ rule); one token over → excluded and band stops.
**Selection G3 — oversized loner:** single turn larger than the whole smooth budget on an otherwise-empty band → included alone (empty-band exception).
**Selection G4 — turnless straggler:** fixture variant with a runtime note between `turn_end` and the next prompt, compacted so the note's neighborhood lands in a band → note rides the following turn's band entry (rule 6: `[inter-turn note]` marker before the entry, its tokens counted in that turn's fill cost); trailing-straggler leg: a note after the last turn → tail.
**Boundary G1 — trajectory:** scripted intake sequence (sums crossing max twice, one monster turn) → committed expected positions after each batch. Floor legs (whole-message rule): protected set = newest tool results joined until the set's sum first reaches/exceeds floor; an oversized newest result is protected alone and the zone legally sits above target (or max) that batch; boundary never lands inside the protected set; at least the newest result is full whenever any exists.

## Chunk Red/Green Detail

Per-chunk TDD tables follow Epic 02's pattern; estimates: Chunk 0 ≈ 6, 1 ≈ 9, 2 ≈ 16 (incl. goldens + restart), 3 ≈ 10, 4 ≈ 13, 5 ≈ 11 — ~65 total. Red exits on the project `red-verify` (no behavior tests); structured-result stubs make Red failures assertion-shaped on the surface ops. Green exits on `green-verify` with test immutability. The process suite runs at story completion (`verify-all`), not in Red/Green loops.

Suite labels for `verify-all` accounting: default suites `ran`; process suite `ran` under flag; no absent/skipped suites in this epic.
